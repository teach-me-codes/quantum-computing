    shor = Shor(15)  # Factorizing the number 15
    result = shor.run(backend)
    print(result.factors)
    ```

#### **2. How does quantum entanglement enhance security in quantum cryptography?**

- Quantum entanglement ensures the security of quantum communication in cryptographic protocols by enabling the detection of eavesdropping attempts. Any outside interference inevitably disrupts the entanglement, thereby alerting the communicating parties to a breach in security. This property forms the cornerstone of quantum key distribution protocols.

#### **3. Can you explain the concept of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and its importance?**

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** involves using quantum mechanics to create and distribute a secure key between two parties. One of the most renowned QKD protocols is the **BB84 protocol**, which utilizes the properties of qubits to establish a secure key between Alice and Bob. Quantum key distribution ensures **information-theoretic security**, guaranteeing that any interception of the key by an eavesdropper will be detected.

    - **Importance of QKD**:
        - *Unbreakable Security*: QKD offers a fundamentally secure method of key distribution, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure the secrecy and integrity of cryptographic keys.
        - *Future-Proofing Against Quantum Attacks*: With the rise of quantum computers and their potential to break classical encryption, QKD paves the way for secure communications resistant to quantum threats.
