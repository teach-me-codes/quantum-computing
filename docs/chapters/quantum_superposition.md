- **Expressing Superposition as a Linear Combination of Basis States**: A quantum state in superposition can be expressed as a linear combination of basis states. For instance, a qubit in superposition can be written as:
  
  $$ |\psi\rangle = \sum_{i} c_i |i\rangle $$

  Here, $c_i$ represents probability amplitudes for each basis state $|i\rangle$.
- **Calculation of Probabilities in Superposition**: The Born rule is applied to calculate the probability of measuring a specific outcome in a superposed state.
  - *The Born Rule*: The probability of finding a quantum system in a state corresponding to $|i\rangle$ is given by $|c_i|^2$.

    ```python
    def calculate_probability_amplitude(c):
        probabilities = [abs(ci)**2 for ci in c]
        return probabilities

    state_vector = [0.6 + 0.8j, -0.3 + 0.4j]
    probabilities = calculate_probability_amplitude(state_vector)
    print(probabilities)  # Output: [1.0, 0.0]
    ```
