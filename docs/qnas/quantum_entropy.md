### What is Quantum Entropy and how is it defined within the context of Quantum Information Theory?

Quantum Entropy is a fundamental concept in Quantum Information Theory that quantifies the uncertainty or randomness associated with a quantum state. It provides a measure of the amount of information needed to fully describe a quantum system. In classical information theory, entropy measures the uncertainty in a probabilistic system, whereas in quantum information theory, entropy extends this concept to quantum states.

In the context of Quantum Information Theory, Quantum Entropy is typically defined using the density matrix representation of a quantum state. For a quantum state represented by the density matrix $$\rho$$, the von Neumann entropy is commonly used to quantify Quantum Entropy:

$$
S(\rho) = - \text{Tr}(\rho \log(\rho))
$$

where:
- $$S(\rho)$$ is the von Neumann entropy.
- $$\rho$$ is the density matrix representing the quantum state.
- $$\text{Tr}$$ denotes the trace operation.
